# LeetCode
Uploading some of my more recent leetcode solutions. 
I hope this repository will be a place to discuss leetcode solutions, please bring up any issues you may have with my solutions and feel free to propose better/alternative approaches to problems.

My most recent LeetCode profile can be found here: [leetcode.com/u/Shmath64/](https://leetcode.com/u/Shmath64/)

### Acknowledgments
Not every single one my solutions is completely original, I certainly have been stumped and looked for inspiration from other solutions. I have unfortunately not kept track of every resource I've ever used but you may find some links in comments in solutions. 
Special shout out to CodingNinja, I often watch his videos on Leetcode problems that stump me: [youtube.com/@CodingNinjaExAmazon](https://www.youtube.com/@CodingNinjaExAmazon/playlists)


(In case you're wondering why every file name starts with a `_`, it's because I want the solutions to be valid Python modules so I can interact with them with a Python REPL)

Thanks for stopping by!
